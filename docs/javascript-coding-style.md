## JavaScript Coding Style


### Spacing and Indentation

* Properties and values should be clearly separated from their selectors using Allman Style indentation, meaning a new line before `{`.
* To increase readability, put spaces between parenthesis `(  )`.
* Additionally, there should be a space after every `,` and a space after every `:`.
* Use `tabs` for semantic indentation, and `spaces` for presentational spacing.
* There should always be a new line at the end of every file.

### Formatting

* Use lowercase letters in hex codes.
* Use `'` not `"`.
* Use `//` for comments, not `/* */`.
* Variables should be written in [CamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) not [snake_case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).
