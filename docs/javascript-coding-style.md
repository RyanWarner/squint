## JavaScript Coding Style


### Spacing and Indentation

* Properties and values should be clearly separated from their selectors using Allman Style indentation, meaning a new line before `{`.
* To increase readability, put spaces between parenthesis `(  )`.
* Additionally, there should be a space after every `,` and a space after every `:`.
* Use `tabs` for semantic indentation, and `spaces` for presentational spacing.
* There should always be a new line at the end of every file.

### Formatting

* Use lowercase letters in hex codes.
* Use `'` not `"`.
* Use `//` for comments, not `/* */`.
* Always specify leading 0s, like `0.5`.
* Use longhand values, be explicit and avoid shorthand.
* Selectors be written in hyphenated lowercase, not [CamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) or [snake_case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).
